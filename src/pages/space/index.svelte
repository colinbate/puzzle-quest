<p>Hello, intrepid puzzler!</p>

<p>
  My name is Rhyd, and I am trying to make my way to Earth. My people love visiting you; however, it is my first time, and I seem to have lost my way. I have tried to contact my own space command for help. Transmission quality is not high, and messages take forever to receive. Perhaps you can help me make sense of the last transmission and find my way to your beautiful planet.
</p>

<p>As you will see, some parts of the message are garbled. My people are very logical but not very straightforward. We like to speak in riddles at times. I apologize if this makes things more complicated. I'm hoping that you can make more sense of it than I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello Rhyd! Four of your colleagues have just come in with information to help you on your way. Or at least that is what they've said, I'm not sure what that information is, it must be something about their wardrobe. They are all wearing Earth clothing of different colors (one of which was blue). Each is wearing a hat, a shirt, and a pair of pants.</p>

<ol>
  <li>No two shirts, hats, or pairs of pants were the same color.</li>
  <li>No single colleague was wearing two articles of the same color.</li>
  <li>Each color appeared twice.</li>
  <li>Caltor was wearing green pants.</li>
  <li>The four were Paxon, the one wearing white pants, the one wearing a red hat and the one in the yellow shirt.</li>
  <li>Neither Taplaic nor Paxon was wearing green.</li>
  <li>CJPOP APOP IS AJTCP SO DPNNSA JRCY RIM CJP ENRKG YJTOC ARY ISC ASOI ATCJ CJP ENBP SO DPNNSA LRICY.</li>
  <li>Staal was not wearing white.</li>
  <li>Green and black were not worn together.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure how useful it will be to know what colors everyone is wearing, but knowing my colleagues, it will be meaningful and symbolic. They are always joking about the places they've visited and trying to be taken to your Earth leaders. I don't think any of them have actually had the nerve to do so. At the end of the last transmission, I also received this stream of characters. I initially thought it might have been noise, but I feel like it may somehow be part of the overall message. It may be somewhat scrambled as well.</p>

  I do hope that you can help me. Somehow, I need to find a keyword for my navigation computer that should allow me to find Earth at last.

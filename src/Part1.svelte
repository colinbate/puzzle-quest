<p>Hello, intrepid puzzler!</p>

<p>
  My name is Rhyd, and I am trying to make my way to Earth. My people love visiting you; however, it is my first time, and I seem to have lost my way. I have tried to contact my own space command. Transmission quality is not high, and messages take forever to receive. Perhaps you can help me make sense of the last transmission and find my way to your beautiful planet.
</p>

<p>As you will see, some parts of the message are garbled. My people are very logical but not very straightforward. We like to speak in riddles at times. I apologize if this makes things more complicated. I'm hoping that you can make more sense of it than I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello Rhyd! Four of your colleagues have just come in with information to help you on your way. Or at least that is what they've said, I'm not sure what that information is, it must be something about their wardrobe. They are all wearing Earth clothing of different colors (one of which was blue). Each is wearing a hat, a shirt, and a pair of pants. They each came in one at a time, showcasing their clothing like a show.</p>

<ol>
  <li>No two shirts were the same color; however, two of the hats were the same color, as were two of the pairs of pants.</li>
  <li>No single colleague was wearing two articles of the same color.</li>
  <li>Caltor came in last wearing green pants.</li>
  <li>The four were, in some order, Paxon, the only one wearing white pants, the only one wearing a red hat and the first through the door (who wore a yellow shirt).</li>
  <li>Taplaic entered just after Paxon and was not wearing red or green.</li>
  <li>Staal was wearing the same color hat as the 3rd through the door.</li>
  <li>MCG QABTL TAKMCWHY OGNG B CBM BHJ B DCWNM, BHJ MCGNG OBD BADK B DWHYAG PGAAKO SBWN KR SBHMD.</li>
  <li>Each color appeared precisely two times.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure how useful it will be to know what colors everyone is wearing, but knowing my colleagues, it will be meaningful and symbolic. They are always joking about the places they've visited and trying to be taken to your Earth leaders. I don't think any of them have actually had the nerve to do so. At the end of the last transmission, I also received this stream of characters. I initially thought it might have been noise, but I feel like it may somehow be part of the overall message. It may be somewhat scrambled as well.</p>

  I do hope that you can help me. Somehow, I need to find a keyword for my navigation computer that should allow me to find Earth at last.
